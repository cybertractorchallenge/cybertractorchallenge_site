      <description>Dear Visionaries, Innovators, and those linked to the land,
I am excited to announce that we are gearing up for the 3rd Annual CyberTractor Challenge, set for June 10-14, 2024, near the dynamic campus of Iowa State University, and it&amp;rsquo;s that time where we must start on the process of finding sponsors! With preparations already underway from curriculum planning by our esteemed Board of Directors to student recruitment â€” we are on the threshold of bringing another groundbreaking event to life.</description>
