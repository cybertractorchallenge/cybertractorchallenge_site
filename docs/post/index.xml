      <description>Happy Leap-Year Cybersecurity Enthusiasts and Ag-Tech Innovators!&#xA;CyberTractor Challenge is approaching rapidly, taking place June 10-14 2024 right here in the heartland of the USA! We&amp;rsquo;ve evolved from a single-brand initiative to an independent 501c3 with a broader venture under our shiny new non-profit status. This means more perspectives, more cool tech, and yes, more tractors of more colors! Our event puts you in the room with some of the experts who built the very systems on which you will be training.</description>
