      <description>Happy Leap-Year Cybersecurity Enthusiasts and Ag-Tech Innovators!&#xA;CyberTractor Challenge is approaching rapidly, taking place June 10-14 2024 right here in the heartland of the USA! We&amp;rsquo;ve evolved from a single-brand initiative to an independent 501c3 with a broader venture under our shiny new non-profit status. This means more perspectives, more cool tech, and yes, more tractors of more colors! Our event puts you in the room with some of the experts who built the very systems on which you will be training.</description>

      <description>The CyberTractor Challenge (English: Tractor Hacking) was started by John Deere in 2022 as a sister event to the more established CyberTruck and CyberAuto challenges, focusing on the cybersecurity of their modern connected Agricultural fleet by bringing college and university students to a real farm in Iowa to get hands on experience with real equipment and real cybersecurity + engineering professionals. As the seeds of CyberTractor sprouted, the goals and scope for this &amp;ldquo;challenge&amp;rdquo; have pivoted from focusing on solely the iconic Green and Yellow equipment to include industry peers of all colors.</description>
