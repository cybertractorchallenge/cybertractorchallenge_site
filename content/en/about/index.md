The _CyberTractor Challenge_ (English: _Tractor Hacking_) was started by John Deere in 2022 as a sister event to the more established [CyberTruck](https://cybertruckchallenge.org) and CyberAuto challenges, focusing on the cybersecurity of their modern connected Agricultural fleet by bringing college and university students to a real farm in Iowa to get hands on experience with real equipment and real cybersecurity + engineering professionals. As the seeds of CyberTractor sprouted, the goals and scope for this "challenge" have pivoted from focusing on solely the iconic Green and Yellow equipment to include industry peers of all colors. To aid in accomplishing this goal, CyberTractor Challenge is now a non-profit entity registered under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This new structure allows for the event to focus on the wider cybersecurity challenges faced by the industry as a whole. 

### Why are we moving to this new model? 

Simply put: _Security is EVERYONE'S job_.  

Our world, and now food supply, is interconnected in ways John Deere himself couldn't have dreamed over 200 years ago when he invented the stainless-steel self-scouring plow, requiring solutions to challenges which our next generation must dream of. 

## Our Mission

Assist in cultivating the future workforce by fostering awareness, enthusiasm, professional engagement, and hands-on training in the agricultural connected equipment used to keep the world growing.

Drive the growth of a community of interest for agricultural connected systems' cybersecurity which surpasses individual firms or departments and extends across studies, organizations, and manufacturers to form the next experienced generation of cybersecurity focused engineers and developers.
