Dear Visionaries, Innovators, and those linked to the land,

I am excited to announce that we are gearing up for the 3rd Annual CyberTractor Challenge, set for June 10-14, 2024, near the dynamic campus of Iowa State University, and it's that time where we must start on the process of finding sponsors! With preparations already underway from curriculum planning by our esteemed Board of Directors to student recruitment â€” we are on the threshold of bringing another groundbreaking event to life.

This year, we're excited to announce that CyberTractor Challenge has achieved 501(c)3 status, opening up the arena for all Tractor/Farm Equipment OEMs to join our cause. This exciting development gives way to a new era of sponsorship opportunities, crucial for propelling our event to new heights.

We welcome sponsorships of any magnitude, [please see this page for available sponsorship packages](/static/sponsor_packages)
